# Jimmy Wrangler, Data Explorer Project 

First Dataset: Top Spotify Tracks of 2018
Second Dataset: Top 50 Spotify Songs - 2019

By combining these dataset, I want to figure out the most polular artist in 2018 and 2019 and the different metrics of the songs like danceability, loudness, acousticness, etc.
